    "# Alignment\n",
    "\n",
    "Certainly! Let’s break down how the **alignment** function works, which is designed to align a boid’s velocity with that of its neighbors, helping the group move cohesively in the same direction.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Purpose of the Alignment Function\n",
    "The alignment function ensures that a boid matches its direction and speed with nearby boids. This helps create the smooth, coordinated movement often seen in flocks of birds or schools of fish, where all the individuals seem to move together as one.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step-by-Step Breakdown:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Initialize the Average Velocity Vector**:\n",
    "   - The function begins by initializing an `average_velocity` vector as a zero vector (e.g., `[0, 0, 0]`). This vector will accumulate the velocities of all nearby boids.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Loop Through All Boids**:\n",
    "   - The function then loops through all the boids in the simulation to compare the current boid (whose alignment behavior we are calculating) with every other boid.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Check Distance and Accumulate Velocities**:\n",
    "   - For each other boid, the function calculates the distance between the current boid and that boid.\n",
    "   - If this distance is less than a specified `neighbor_radius` (which defines how close another boid needs to be to be considered a neighbor), the function adds the velocity of that nearby boid to the `average_velocity` vector.\n",
    "   - At the same time, a counter (`count`) is incremented to keep track of how many neighboring boids were found.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Calculate the Average Velocity**:\n",
    "   - After looping through all the boids, if any neighbors were found (`count` > 0), the function divides the accumulated `average_velocity` by the number of neighbors (`count`). This gives the average velocity of all the neighboring boids.\n",
    "   \n",
    "5. **Adjust the Steering Vector**:\n",
    "   - The function then normalizes this average velocity vector to ensure it's consistent with the boid's `max_speed`. This means adjusting the magnitude of the velocity to match the maximum speed the boid can move at.\n",
    "   - The steering vector is then calculated as the difference between this normalized average velocity and the current boid’s velocity. This difference represents how much the boid needs to adjust its speed and direction to align with its neighbors.\n",
    "   - Finally, the resulting vector is scaled by an `alignment_strength` factor, which controls how strongly the boid responds to the alignment behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Return the Steering Vector**:\n",
    "   - The function returns this steering vector, which the boid will use to adjust its velocity to better match the direction and speed of its neighbors.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Formula Representation:\n",
    "If `V[i]` is the velocity of the current boid and `V[j]` is the velocity of another boid, then for each boid within the `neighbor_radius`, the average velocity is calculated as:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\[\n",
    "\\text{average\\_velocity} = \\frac{1}{\\text{count}} \\sum_{j \\in \\text{neighbors}} V[j]\n",
    "\\]\n",
    "\n",
    "The steering vector `steer` is then:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\[\n",
    "\\text{steer} = \\text{normalize}(\\text{average\\_velocity}) \\times \\text{max\\_speed} - V[i]\n",
    "\\]\n",
    "\n",
    "Where `neighbors` is the set of boids within the `neighbor_radius` of the current boid.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example:\n",
    "Suppose the current boid has a velocity `[2, 2, 0]` and there are two neighboring boids within the `neighbor_radius` with velocities:\n",
    "- Boid 1: `[3, 2, 1]`\n",
    "- Boid 2: `[1, 3, 1]`\n",
    "\n",
    "The average velocity would be calculated as:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\[\n",
    "\\text{average\\_velocity} = \\frac{[3, 2, 1] + [1, 3, 1]}{2} = \\frac{[4, 5, 2]}{2} = [2, 2.5, 1]\n",
    "\\]\n",
    "\n",
    "This average velocity would then be normalized and scaled to the boid’s `max_speed`, and the difference between this and the current boid’s velocity would be used to calculate the steering adjustment. If `max_speed` is 4, for example, the normalized vector might become something like `[2.1, 2.625, 1.05]`, leading to a small adjustment in the current boid’s direction and speed.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary:\n",
    "The alignment function aligns a boid’s velocity with the average velocity of its nearby neighbors. This ensures that all boids in the group move in roughly the same direction and at a similar speed, creating the coordinated, flock-like behavior seen in many animals.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Separation\n",
    "Certainly! Let's break down how the **separation** function works, focusing on how it calculates the steering force that prevents boids from getting too close to each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Purpose of the Separation Function\n",
    "The separation function ensures that a boid maintains a certain minimum distance from its neighbors, preventing collisions and overcrowding. If another boid gets too close, the function calculates a force to push the boid away.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step-by-Step Breakdown:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Initialize the Steering Vector**:\n",
    "   - The function starts by initializing a `steer` vector as a zero vector (e.g., `[0, 0, 0]`). This vector will eventually accumulate the repulsion forces from all nearby boids that are too close.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Loop Through All Boids**:\n",
    "   - The function loops through all the boids in the simulation to check the distance between the current boid (whose separation behavior we are calculating) and every other boid.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Check Distance and Accumulate Steering Forces**:\n",
    "   - For each other boid, the function calculates the distance between the current boid and the other boid.\n",
    "   - If this distance is less than a specified `separation_distance` (which defines how close is \"too close\"), the function calculates a repulsion force. This force is proportional to the inverse of the distance, meaning that the closer the other boid is, the stronger the repulsion.\n",
    "   - The repulsion force is calculated as:\n",
    "     \\[\n",
    "     \\text{force} = \\frac{\\text{current\\_boid\\_position} - \\text{other\\_boid\\_position}}{\\text{distance}}\n",
    "     \\]\n",
    "   - This force is then added to the `steer` vector, and a counter (`count`) is incremented to track how many boids are too close.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Average the Steering Force**:\n",
    "   - After looping through all the boids, if any nearby boids were found (`count` > 0), the accumulated `steer` vector is averaged by dividing it by `count`. This gives the average repulsion force.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Adjust the Steering Force**:\n",
    "   - The function then normalizes this average steering vector to ensure it's consistent with the boid's maximum speed, and subtracts the current boid's velocity to calculate the actual steering adjustment needed.\n",
    "   - Finally, the resulting vector is scaled by a `separation_strength` factor, which controls how strongly the boid reacts to nearby boids.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Return the Steering Vector**:\n",
    "   - The function returns this steering vector, which the boid will use to adjust its velocity and move away from nearby boids.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Formula Representation:\n",
    "If `P[i]` is the position of the current boid and `P[j]` is the position of another boid, then for each boid within the `separation_distance`, the steering force is calculated as:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\[\n",
    "\\text{force} = \\frac{P[i] - P[j]}{\\text{distance}(P[i], P[j])}\n",
    "\\]\n",
    "\n",
    "The overall steering vector `steer` is:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\[\n",
    "\\text{steer} = \\frac{1}{\\text{count}} \\sum_{j \\in \\text{too\\_close}} \\frac{P[i] - P[j]}{\\text{distance}(P[i], P[j])}\n",
    "\\]\n",
    "\n",
    "Where `too_close` is the set of boids within the `separation_distance` of the current boid.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example:\n",
    "Imagine there are two boids within the `separation_distance` of the current boid with the following positions:\n",
    "- Current Boid: `[5, 5, 5]`\n",
    "- Nearby Boid 1: `[6, 5, 5]` (1 unit away)\n",
    "- Nearby Boid 2: `[4, 4, 5]` (about 1.41 units away)\n",
    "\n",
    "For each nearby boid, the function would calculate the repulsion force:\n",
    "- From Boid 1:\n",
    "  \\[\n",
    "  \\text{force} = \\frac{[5, 5, 5] - [6, 5, 5]}{1} = [-1, 0, 0]\n",
    "  \\]\n",
    "- From Boid 2:\n",
    "  \\[\n",
    "  \\text{force} = \\frac{[5, 5, 5] - [4, 4, 5]}{1.41} \\approx [0.707, 0.707, 0]\n",
    "  \\]\n",
    "\n",
    "These forces are then added together and averaged (if there are multiple nearby boids) to determine the direction the boid should steer to move away from others. The final steering vector would guide the boid away from the crowded area.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary:\n",
    "The separation function calculates a repulsion force for each nearby boid that is too close and combines these forces to steer the current boid away from them, preventing collisions and ensuring that boids maintain a comfortable distance from each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Cohesion\n",
    "The calculation of the center of mass in the cohesion function is done by averaging the positions of nearby boids within a certain radius. Here’s a step-by-step breakdown of how this calculation works:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Initialize the Center of Mass**:\n",
    "   - The function starts by initializing a variable `center_of_mass` as a zero vector (e.g., `[0, 0, 0]`). This will eventually hold the average position of all nearby boids.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Loop Through All Boids**:\n",
    "   - The function then loops through all the boids in the simulation, checking the distance between the current boid (the one whose behavior we are calculating) and every other boid.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Check Distance and Accumulate Positions**:\n",
    "   - For each other boid, it calculates the distance between the current boid and that boid.\n",
    "   - If this distance is less than a specified `neighbor_radius` (which defines how close other boids need to be to be considered neighbors), the position of that nearby boid is added to the `center_of_mass` variable.\n",
    "   - At the same time, a counter (`count`) is incremented to keep track of how many neighboring boids were within the radius.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Calculate the Average**:\n",
    "   - After looping through all the boids, if any neighbors were found (`count` > 0), the function divides the accumulated `center_of_mass` by the number of neighbors (`count`). This operation gives the average position of all the neighboring boids, which is effectively the center of mass.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Steer Towards the Center of Mass**:\n",
    "   - Finally, the function calculates a direction vector from the current boid’s position to this calculated center of mass and uses this to adjust the boid’s velocity towards the group.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Formula Representation:\n",
    "If `P[i]` is the position of the `i-th` boid, then the center of mass (CoM) is calculated as:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\[\n",
    "\\text{CoM} = \\frac{1}{\\text{count}} \\sum_{j \\in \\text{neighbors}} P[j]\n",
    "\\]\n",
    "\n",
    "Where `neighbors` is the set of boids within the `neighbor_radius` of the current boid. The result is a position vector that represents the average position of all the neighboring boids.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example:\n",
    "Suppose there are three boids within the `neighbor_radius` with positions:\n",
    "- Boid 1: `[2, 3, 1]`\n",
    "- Boid 2: `[4, 2, 3]`\n",
    "- Boid 3: `[3, 5, 2]`\n",
    "\n",
    "The center of mass would be calculated as:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\[\n",
    "\\text{CoM} = \\frac{[2, 3, 1] + [4, 2, 3] + [3, 5, 2]}{3} = \\frac{[9, 10, 6]}{3} = [3, \\frac{10}{3}, 2]\n",
    "\\]\n",
    "\n",
    "So, `[3, 3.33, 2]` would be the center of mass that the current boid will steer towards.\n",
